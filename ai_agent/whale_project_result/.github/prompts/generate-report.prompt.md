# Generate Market Report

Use the [report-generator](../agents/report-generator.md) agent to create an HTML dashboard from the latest market data and whale alerts.

Read `data/market_data.json` and `data/whale_alerts.json`, then generate a dark-themed, responsive dashboard at `docs/index.html` with Chart.js visualizations, whale alert tables, and market summary cards.
