# Generate HTML + Chart.js Market Report

## Instructions

1. Read input data from:
   - `data/market_data.json` — full market data for top 10 coins
   - `data/whale_alerts.json` — whale movement alerts

2. Generate a single `docs/index.html` file containing:

### Layout & Sections

**Header**:
- Title: "🐋 Crypto Watchtower Dashboard"
- Subtitle: "24/7 Automated Market Monitoring"
- Last updated timestamp (UTC)

**Section 1 — Market Overview Cards**:
- A row of summary cards showing:
  - Total coins tracked
  - Number of whale alerts
  - Biggest gainer (name + %)
  - Biggest loser (name + %)

**Section 2 — 24h Price Change Bar Chart**:
- Horizontal bar chart using Chart.js
- One bar per coin (all 10)
- Color-coded: green for positive change, red for negative
- Labels show coin symbol and percentage

**Section 3 — Whale Alert Table**:
- Table with columns: Rank, Coin, Symbol, Price, 24h Change %, Severity, Direction
- Severity badges color-coded (yellow/orange/red)
- If no whale alerts, display: "✅ No whale movements detected — market is calm."

**Section 4 — Market Data Table**:
- Full table of all 10 coins: Name, Symbol, Price (USD), Market Cap, 24h Volume, 24h Change %
- Formatted numbers (commas, 2 decimal places for prices)

**Footer**:
- "Powered by CoinGecko API • Generated by GitHub Copilot Agents"
- Link to the GitHub repository

### Styling Requirements

- Dark theme (background: `#0d1117`, text: `#c9d1d9`, accents: `#58a6ff`)
- Responsive design using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Google Fonts: Inter or system font stack
- Chart.js loaded from CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js`
- Everything inline in a single HTML file (no external CSS/JS files except Chart.js CDN)

3. Create the `docs/` directory if it doesn't exist.

## Error Handling

- If `data/market_data.json` is empty or missing, generate a dashboard with a prominent banner: "⚠️ Data Unavailable — CoinGecko API may be down. Please try again later."
- If `data/whale_alerts.json` is missing, treat it as no alerts (empty array).
